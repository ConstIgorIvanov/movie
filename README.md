### About

List of movies retrieved from yts.mx/api.
On the main page there is a list of films, with brief information about the film.
A separate page of the current movie (I don't know why I decided to take the information for the request from the link - most likely I tested the capabilities of ReactRouterDom, now the application crashes when updating the page of the current movie)
Simple custom pagination and skeleton.
Adding comments to a movie in localStorage using Middleware (checked local Storage and middleware)

### Using

* ReduxToolKit
* TypeScript
* scss-module
* react-router-dom

### Note

API sometimes returns empty ratings, description, or other items.
